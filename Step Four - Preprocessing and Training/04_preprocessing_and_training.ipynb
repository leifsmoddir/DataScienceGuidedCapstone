    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

The `learning_curve` function does this conveniently."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "Using the average weekend ticket price, we were able to get a baseline model for performance. Baseline models will have an $R^2$ = 0. Models that have worse predictions than this baseline will have a negative $R^2$, which is what we see when we apply this model to predict unknown values from the test set. That is because $R^2$ tells us how much of the variance that is explained beyond that of using just the mean, and we were using just the mean. We then further analyzed the average weekend price dataset using the metrics mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE), which are used to measure accuracy for continuous variables. The MAE indicated that, on average, we might expect to be off by around \\\\$19 if we guessed ticket price based on an average of known values. The MSE indicated that, on average, we might expect to be off by around \\\\$24 if you guessed ticket price based on an average of the square errors.\n",

After scaling the data to zero mean and unit variance by simple linear regression, MAE, and MSE. This simple linear regression model explains over 80% of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set, and using this MAE and MSE, we’d be expected to estimate a ticket price within \\\\$9 or \\\\$12 or so of the real price, respectively. We repeated this analysis using *mean* to impute the missing values, and performed simple linear regression, MAE, and MSE. While the mean values were noticeably higher than the median values, the results were not very different to when the median was used for imputing missing values.\n",

    "We suspect the simple linear regression models are overfitting because of the high $R^2$ and the number of features we blindly used. Moving forward, we need a subset of features in order to generalize better. In order to this we used k-fold cross validation (CV) which will help us select the best features to use in our machine learning models by resampling. The parameter ‘k’ in ‘k-fold’ refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into to evaluate modeling on the data set. The CV results indicate that a good value for k is 8, having the highest $R^2$ value of approximately 0.67, and the smallest error bars for +/- 1 standard deviation. The 8 best features, in order of feature strength, are as follows: \n",

Continuing further down this path (trying different values for k) would produce a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set, but fails to generalize to new data.\n",
